# Project Name: Iris Dataset Analysis and Clustering

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and clustering of the Iris dataset using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and data science, containing measurements of three different species of iris flowers.

## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
In this project, we explore the Iris dataset to gain insights and perform clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The project includes the following steps:

## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting"></a>
To run this project on your local machine, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## 3. Data Cleaning <a name="cleaning"></a>
We begin by loading the Iris dataset and checking for any missing values or duplicates. Fortunately, there are no missing values or duplicated entries in this dataset.

## 4. Visualizing the Iris Dataset <a name="viz"></a>
We use Seaborn to create scatterplots for joint relationships and histograms for univariate distributions of the dataset. The visualizations help us understand the relationships between different features and the distribution of data points among species.

## 5. Clustering Using K-Means <a name="cluster"></a>
To perform clustering, we use the K-Means algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters. We use the "elbow method" to determine the number of clusters that best fit the data. Once the optimal number of clusters is found, we apply K-Means clustering and visualize the clusters using scatter plots. We also display the cluster centers.

## 6. Conclusion <a name="conc"></a>
In conclusion, this project provides an example of data analysis and clustering using the Iris dataset. It demonstrates the use of Python and popular data science libraries to gain insights from data and perform machine learning tasks.
