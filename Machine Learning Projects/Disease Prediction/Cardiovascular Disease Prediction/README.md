# Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Networks
This project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

We will be using some common Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Furthermore, for the machine learning side of this project, we will be using sklearn and keras. Import these libraries using the cell below to ensure you have them correctly installed.

<h3>The dataset is available through the University of California, Irvine Machine learning repository.</h3>

This dataset contains patient data concerning heart disease diagnosis that was collected at several locations around the world. There are 76 attributes, including age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholestoral levels, echocardiogram data, exercise habits, and many others. To data, all published studies using this data focus on a subset of 14 attributes - so we will do the same. More specifically, we will use the data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
