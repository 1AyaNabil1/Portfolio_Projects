# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest
This project will focus on predicting Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Based on attributes such as cell radius, cell texture,  fractal_dimension, and other characteristic attributes. This project will utilize a dataset of 569 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

We will be using some common Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. Furthermore, for the machine learning side of this project, we will be using sklearn.

<h3>The dataset is available through the University of California, Irvine Machine learning repository.</h3>

This dataset contains data concerning breast cancer diagnosis that was collected at several locations around the world. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
