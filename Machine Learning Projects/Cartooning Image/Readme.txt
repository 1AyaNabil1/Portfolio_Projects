- I used Opencv, matplotlib packages to process the image and plot it.
- I used easygui and sys modules to open the file box.
- I used os and tkinter libraries to read the path and save the image to that path.

° First, we created the main window and file box and make the cartooning button in the main window.
° Second, read the image and scale its colour to grayscale, then smooth the grayscale of the image.
° Third, retrieve and adjust the edge of the image, then prepare the mask image and change some colours to give the image a cartoon effect.
° In the last step, we plot the image with all of its effects.

Finalement, the image is cartooned. So we will save it on the desktop 🎊❤️


**note: the five images that appear are the phases of cartooning the image so the last image that has been saved is the desired one
