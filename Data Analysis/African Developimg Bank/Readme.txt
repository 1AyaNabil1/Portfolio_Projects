First: I downloaded the African Development Bank for finance dataset from Kaggle:

Second: I used pandas and matplotlib packages to read the CSV file and plot the dataset to work with it.

Third: I cleaned the data as I removed the null and empty sets, and then I changed the date as I need to work only on the year.

After that, I removed the columns that I don't need. I showed the data using a bar graph to show the repeated countries and the highest ones.

Fourth: I merged the repeated countries and used the sum function so I can sum the "Commitment in U.A", which is the default currency in the African bank,

The last step: I used the percentage to show the highest 3 countries represented on the graph.

So I got that Tunisia is the highest country that spends money on finance after multinational countries.
